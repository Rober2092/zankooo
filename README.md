# The House Of Zankooo
Group Project 3

## Purpose

Build a full-stack e-commerce website for a startup fashion retailer, using the MERN stack to interact with company and customer data. The application allows users to browse and save items to their personal shopping cart, and purchase items online using an integrated payment platform to complete their orders. 

<br> 

- Users can select categories of fashion merchandise from the homepage. From there they can select from various subcategories to further narrow their search and view products, descriptions and price. 

- Users will arrive at a product page where they can add, remove, and change quantities of items in their shopping bag.

- The user can complete payment directly from the app using the Stripe API payment platform.
